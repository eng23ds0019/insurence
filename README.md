Farmer Insurance Assistant

An AI-powered platform designed to help farmers easily claim insurance, track claim status, and discover the best insurance schemes (government and private). The system leverages OCR technology to auto-fill forms from uploaded insurance documents and uses AI-based recommendations to guide farmers in selecting the most suitable insurance schemes based on crop conditions and other details.

🚀 Features

📄 OCR-based Auto-fill – Upload insurance documents, and the system will read and auto-fill the required details.

✅ Claim Management – Farmers can claim and check the status of their insurance.

🏛️ Government & Private Schemes – Integrated database of agriculture-related insurance schemes for easy access.

🤖 AI Recommendation System – Suggests the best insurance schemes based on farmer input (crop type, condition, risk factors, etc.).

🌐 User-friendly Dashboard – Simple interface designed for farmers with multilingual support (future scope).
